## Materials and Data

]
This dataset is open and free to use for research. It is explained in detail in the paper by **Moro et al., 2014**.

In this project, we will perform a preliminary analysis to understand which customers are more likely to respond positively to a bankâ€™s phone call (i.e., subscribe to a term deposit). This relates to **bank scoring**, where we predict client behavior based on their characteristics.

---

### Some Questions We Will Answer:

* What percentage of clients accepted the offer?
* What are the average values of numeric features among those who accepted?
* What is the average call duration for successful calls?
* What is the average age of those who are single and subscribed?
* What are the average age and call duration across different job types?

We will also visualize the results to help with planning better marketing strategies.
